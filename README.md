# Customer Engagement & Revenue Analysis Dashboard (Excel)

## 📊 Project Overview

This project is an Excel-based analytics dashboard built to explore customer behavior and revenue performance in an e-commerce setting. Using transactional data, I created pivot-driven summaries and visualizations to highlight engagement tiers, product categories, and regional revenue trends.

The dashboard provides a clear snapshot of business performance and customer value distribution, enabling stakeholders to make informed, data-driven decisions.
